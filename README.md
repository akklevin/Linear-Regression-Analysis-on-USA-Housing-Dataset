# Linear-Regression-Analysis-on-USA-Housing-Dataset

This project analyzes the USA Housing dataset using a linear regression model to understand the relationship between housing attributes and prices. It will identify key features influencing price predictions, assess feature importance, and refine the model by potentially dropping less impactful features. The analysis aims to provide insights for real estate professionals and set the stage for future exploration of additional features and more complex modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
